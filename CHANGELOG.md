# Changelog

All notable changes to `ReceiptAnchor` and `RefundVault` are recorded here.

The two contracts are versioned together and share a tag. Versioning follows the
policy in [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md): while the project is pre-1.0,
breaking changes bump the **minor** version, and they are called out as such.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`governance` (issue #441): anonymous voting with linkable ring signatures.**
  Members can register Ristretto255 voting keys and cast weighted votes through
  LSAG proofs over equal-weight member anonymity sets. Proposal-scoped key images
  prevent repeat anonymous votes without storing or emitting the signer identity.
- **`cross-chain` (issue #455): LayerZero omnichain dispute bridging.** New
  `layerzero` module lets decentralized arbitrators on remote chains deliver
  dispute resolutions to Soroban through a LayerZero endpoint. The admin
  registers the endpoint (`set_layerzero_endpoint`) and trusted peer
  contracts per source chain (`set_trusted_peer`); the endpoint delivers
  packets with `lz_receive(src_eid, sender, nonce, payload)`, which validates
  the sender against the trusted-peer registry, enforces strictly-advancing
  per-channel packet nonces (replays rejected with `StaleState`),
  bounds-checks the versioned dispute payload (`parse_dispute_payload`),
  refuses a dispute id that already settled (`AlreadyRefunded`), and emits
  `DisputeResolvedEvent`. A mock-endpoint integration suite proves the real
  auth path: only the registered endpoint calling in can pass
  `require_auth`.
- **`state-channel` (issue #488): Lightning-style pre-image reveal
  mechanics.** New `hashlock` module locks a slice of a channel's free
  escrow against `sha256(preimage)` (`add_hashlock_payment`) and settles it
  when the preimage is revealed on-chain (`reveal_preimage`, permissionless,
  `InvalidPreimage` on mismatch, `HtlcNotPending` on double reveal),
  crediting the receiver's balance and emitting
  `HashlockPaymentRevealedEvent` carrying the hashlock — never the secret.
  `close_channel_with_preimage` ties the reveal into the close flow: the
  sender's signed final state plus the receiver's preimage settle the
  invoice atomically, with the receiver's payout becoming
  `balance + amount` before the challenge window starts. Hashlock
  reservations share the escrow ceiling with HTLC reservations
  (`get_reserved_escrow`), so no combination of states, hops and invoices
  can overdraw escrow.
- **`governance` (issue #483): proposal simulation hooks.** Proposals can
  carry a `SimulationReport` from a registered simulator contract
  (`ProposalSimulator::simulate` dry-runs the exact calldata off-chain, the
  on-chain side cannot): `propose_with_simulation` verifies the report's
  simulator is the registered one (its `require_auth` co-signs the
  creation), that `sim_hash` re-derives to the canonical
  `sim_payload` binding this proposal id and this exact calldata, and that
  the outcome is `SIM_OK` — a proposal the dry-run says would revert is
  rejected at creation (`SimulationFailed`) and never reaches a vote.
  `set_simulation_config` turns mandatory simulation on/off per body; when
  mandatory, the plain `propose` path fails with `SimulationRequired`.
  Reports are stored under their own key (`get_simulation_report`) so the
  `Proposal` record shape is unchanged.
- **`reputation` (issue #450): soulbound tokens for verified merchants.** New
  `sbt` module mints non-transferable KYC / volume-tier credentials
  (`Verified` / `Trusted` / `Premium`) bound to one address each, issued and
  governed by the contract authority (`issue` / `revoke` / `slash`).
  `transfer` and `approve` exist only to revert with typed errors
  (`SbtNonTransferable` / `SbtApprovalDisabled`), so a credential can never
  be bought, borrowed or farmed; a revoke burns the credential and writes a
  permanent tombstone that blocks re-issue, while a slash flags it in place
  as a public record.
- **`reputation` (issue #452): on-chain credit scoring for buyers.** New
  `credit_score` module maintains a dynamic 0–1000 score per buyer: the
  escrow authority records successful completions (growth of 25% of the
  remaining headroom per completion, `record_completion` with replay-protected
  escrow ids) and fraudulent dispute losses (a 50%-of-current-score penalty,
  `record_fraud`); scores decay 1% of the headroom above a floor of 100 per
  ~10 days of inactivity and start neutral at 500. `get_score` is read-only,
  and zero-fee tiers unlock by score (half fee at the gold cut-off, zero at
  `zero_fee_tier`, both re-tunable by the authority via `set_score_config`).
- **`reputation` (issue #451): tiered NFT dispute-resolution badges for
  arbitrators.** New `accensa-reputation` contract tracks each arbitrator's
  lifetime accurate dispute resolutions — recorded only by the arbiter
  authority bound at initialization, keyed by caller-supplied dispute ids
  with replay protection — and mints a non-transferable Bronze badge on the
  first accepted resolution, upgrading it in place to Silver at 50 and Gold
  at 100 accurate resolutions (`BadgeMintedEvent` / `BadgeUpgradedEvent`).
- **Tiered Fee Hook**: Implemented Tiered Fee Assessment Hook in Refund-Vault-Factory Deployments (issue #375).
- **Batch Transaction Pipeline**: Added Batch Transaction Execution Pipeline to Multisig-Account (issue #385).
- **Zero-Knowledge Commitments**: Implemented Zero-Knowledge Commitment Verification for State-Channel Off-Chain Settlements (issue #386).
- **Reentrancy Guard Protocol**: Implemented Cross-Contract Call Reentrancy Guard Protocol (issue #388).
- **`state-channel` (issue #458): virtual multi-hop HTLCs.** New `htlc` module
  locks slices of a channel's free escrow against a SHA-256 hash lock and
  settles them with a preimage (`add_htlc` / `resolve_htlc` / `refund_htlc`).
  Hops may be linked to an upstream parent, and a linked hop's timeout must be
  **strictly smaller** than its parent's, so a route's timeouts decrease
  downstream and an intermediary can always pull the upstream hop through
  before it expires. Pending reservations are excluded from the sender's free
  balance, and refunds release them permissionlessly after the timeout.
- **`state-channel` (issue #459): watchtower reward bounties.** The receiver
  may attach a bounty (`set_watchtower_bounty`, capped at 20%) that pays a
  fraction of the recovered balance to the watchtower that files a successful
  counter-proof on their behalf (`watchtower_counter_evidence`). The reward is
  carved out of the receiver's settlement payout at `finalize_dispute` and is
  one-shot, so escrow still balances exactly.
- **`state-channel` (issue #460): channel splicing.** `splice_in` / `splice_out`
  resize an open channel's capacity in place — adding sender funds or
  withdrawing only the sender's uncommitted escrow — while the off-chain state
  keeps running. Both parties must authorize the new capacity limit.
- **`treasury` (issue #465): automated governance-token buyback & burn.** New
  `buyback` module spends accumulated protocol fees on the governance token via
  a pluggable `DexRouter`, verifies the swap against a caller-supplied slippage
  floor, and sends the proceeds to a configured burn address. Admin configures
  it once with `set_buyback_config`; anyone may trigger a swap with
  `execute_buyback` above the configured minimum size.
- **`common`: standardized read-only telemetry view for frontend dashboards.**
  New `telemetry` module (`contracts/common/src/telemetry.rs`) defines the
  canonical `Telemetry` response struct — total/open/closed/disputed/finalized
  channel counts, active escrow sum, and cumulative fees collected, stamped
  with the ledger sequence and wall-clock timestamp — plus the
  `TelemetryProvider` trait and generated `TelemetryClient` so dashboards pull
  one aggregated snapshot cross-contract. The view is strictly read-only:
  no writes, no TTL extension, no authorization, and O(1) targeted storage
  reads (one `instance().get` per field, never record iteration), so the CPU
  cost is independent of channel/refund volume. Includes unit, read-only
  property, and completeness tests.
- **`common` (issue #436): constant-time cryptographic comparison.** New
  `constant_time_eq(a, b)` helper (`contracts/common/src/constant_time.rs`)
  compares byte slices without short-circuiting: every byte and the length
  difference are folded into one OR accumulator that is inspected exactly once
  at the end, and `core::hint::black_box` stops the optimizer re-introducing the
  early exit. Intended for MAC/token/digest equality where a shared-prefix
  timing leak matters.
- **`multisig-account` (issue #434): weight-based threshold voting.** Signers
  now carry a `u32` weight (default `1`), and `__check_auth` admits a call when
  the aggregate weight of the attached approvers reaches the threshold rather
  than the raw signer count. Governance (the account's own threshold
  authorization) updates a signer with `set_signer_weight`, adds/removes
  weighted signers with `add_signer` / `remove_signer`, and every mutation
  enforces the invariant `total_signers_weight >= threshold`.
  `rotate_signers_and_threshold` keeps the weighted bookkeeping consistent and
  refuses a rotation that would break that invariant.
- **`upto-authorization` (issue #435): inactivity auto-cancellation.** New
  `cancel_inactive_escrow(payment_id)` lets the buyer unilaterally release an
  authorization that has gone unclaimed for the governance-set inactivity
  window (`set_inactivity_timeout`, default ~30 days), zeroing the outstanding
  allowance and deleting the record to reclaim its rent. Only the buyer's
  authorization is required — never the facilitator's. Emits
  `EscrowCancelledInactivity`.
- **`treasury` (issue #444): automated AMM fee liquidation.** New `liquidation`
  module (`contracts/treasury/src/liquidation.rs`) with abstracted `Amm` and
  `PriceFeed` clients. Governance whitelists an AMM (`whitelist_amm`), sets the
  primary stablecoin (`set_stable_token`) and price feed (`set_price_feed`);
  `liquidate_fees(token_in, amount_in, max_slippage_bps)` derives a minimum
  output from the oracle price, swaps through the AMM, and rejects any delivery
  below that floor or below what the AMM reported.
- **`common` (issue #463): standardized event emission for indexer subgraphs.**
  Defines canonical `[Protocol, Module, Action]` topic schema (`PROTOCOL = symbol_short!("accensa")`)
  and typed event payloads (`TransferEventPayload`, `RefundEventPayload`, `ChannelStatePayload`,
  `AnchorEventPayload`) for granular GraphQL indexing.
- **`state-channel` (issue #461): ephemeral key delegation for mobile wallets.**
  Adds `DelegationCertificate` allowing temporary Ed25519 signing keys to act on
  behalf of master keys within a ledger sequence window. Supports both
  channel-scoped and wildcard delegations, verified on-chain in
  `update_state_delegated` and `close_channel_delegated`.
- **`cross-chain` (issue #457): Wormhole VAA parsing and guardian verification.**
  Parses Wormhole VAA binary envelopes and verifies guardian secp256k1 signatures
  over double-keccak256 body digests via `env.crypto().secp256k1_recover`. Enforces
  strictly ascending guardian index ordering and quorum requirements (`(2N/3) + 1`)
  against stored active `GuardianSet` records.
- **`cross-chain` (issue #456): outbound withdrawal bridging requests.** Implements
  `withdraw_to_evm` on `CrossChainBridge`, burning wrapped tokens on Soroban,
  incrementing a monotonic sequence number, and emitting standardized
  `OutboundBridgePayload` events under `(bridge, withdraw, sequence)` for
  relayer consumption. Includes admin-controlled pause/unpause toggles.
- **`refund-vault-factory` (issue #464): protocol TVL query.** New read-only
  `get_tvl(asset)` sums the `asset` balance of every vault the factory has
  deployed — read from the SEP-41 token contract rather than the vault's own
  bookkeeping — so one call answers "how much value is locked?" for
  DefiLlama-style analytics. A vault configured with a different token holds
  no `asset` and contributes `0`, so a single factory can host vaults across
  many assets.
- **`treasury` (issue #467): token vesting schedules.** New contract
  (`contracts/treasury`, `src/vesting.rs`) releasing team/investor
  allocations linearly over four years after a one-year cliff. The admin
  registers a `VestingSchedule` per beneficiary with `add_schedule` (or
  `add_team_schedule` for the 1y-cliff/4y-window defaults) and the
  beneficiary calls `claim_vested` to withdraw whatever has unlocked;
  `vested_amount` / `claimable` preview the curve without changing state. A
  schedule can never pay out more than its `total`, and a claim with nothing
  new unlocked fails with `Error::NothingToClaim`.
- **`treasury` (issue #466): diversified stablecoin yield strategies.** New
  `strategies` module (`contracts/treasury/src/strategies.rs`) splitting idle
  reserves across several whitelisted yield protocols. Governance approves
  addresses with `whitelist_strategy` and sets percentages with
  `set_allocations` (weights in basis points, summing to exactly `10_000`);
  `rebalance_portfolio` then recalls every strategy and redeploys the balance
  minus the liquid reserve (`set_reserve_bps`, 100% liquid by default), and
  `recall_strategy` brings a single position — and the yield riding on it —
  home early. A `Strategy` trait (`deposit` / `withdraw` / `total_balance` /
  `accrued_yield`, mirroring `refund-vault`'s yield hook) is the adapter
  interface. Strategies stay untrusted: returns are checked against the
  treasury's own token balance delta (`Error::StrategyUnderpaid`) and every
  strategy call runs under a reentrancy lock (`Error::ReentrancyBlocked`).
- **`state-channel` (issue #471): batched Ed25519 verification.** New `crypto`
  module (`crypto::verify_signatures`) verifies a flat array of
  signer/signature pairs against one canonical payload in a single pass, and
  length-checks the pairing before touching the host (a mismatch returns
  `Error::InvalidSignature`; a forged signature still traps). `mutual_close`
  routes both of its signatures through it.
- **`refund-vault` (issue #473): partial-refund settlement preview.** New
  read-only `preview_settlement(payment_ref, amount, payment_amount)` reports
  exactly how a partial refund would split — the buyer's payout, the fee, the
  remainder the merchant retains, and the running cumulative total — including
  the fee's round-up dust. The ceiling rule and fee split now live once, in
  `settlement::resolve_ceiling` / `settlement::split_amount`, and are shared
  with the live `refund` path so a preview can never disagree with the
  transfer it describes.
- **`multisig-account`: emergency pause circuit breaker.** `pause(caller)` /
  `unpause(caller)` may be called by the account itself (`threshold` signers)
  or a security guardian set with `set_guardian` (threshold only). While
  paused, `__check_auth` refuses every outbound authorization, including
  sub-threshold spends, with `Error::Paused` (10); only the account's own
  `pause`, `unpause`, `set_guardian` and `rotate_signers_and_threshold` stay
  authorizable, and queued timelock transactions cannot execute. Read-only
  queries are unaffected. Adds `is_paused`, `get_guardian`, `PausedEvent`,
  `UnpausedEvent` and `GuardianSetEvent`.
- **`upto-authorization`: slippage tolerance.** New
  `authorize_with_slippage(payment_id, from, to, cap, expiry, max_slippage_bps)`
  lets `settle` charge up to `cap + floor(cap * bps / 10_000)`; the token
  allowance covers that maximum. `authorize` and `authorize_signed` are
  unchanged (0 bps). The bound is computed without forming `cap * bps`, so it
  cannot overflow; `bps` above 10,000 fails with `Error::InvalidSlippage`
  (11) and an unrepresentable maximum with `Error::AmountOverflow` (12).
  `AuthorizationRecord` and `AuthorizeEvent` gain a `max_slippage_bps` field.
- **`receipt-anchor`: `verify_receipt_leaf(shard_id, root, leaf, proof)`.**
  Verifies a sorted-pair Merkle proof (ADR-001) against the shard's retained
  roots. The fold lives in the new `merkle` module. Worst case (depth 10):
  2.81M CPU instructions, 1.52 MB memory; see `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.
- **`receipt-shard` (issue #419): shard health diagnostics.** New read-only
  `get_shard_diagnostics()` returns a `ShardDiagnostics` snapshot: assigned
  range, pruning cursor (oldest unpruned batch), high-water batch id, live
  batch and leaf counts, lifetime leaf total, live batches still inside the
  retention window (`active_dispute_count`), deepest Merkle tree anchored,
  persistent storage entries, and a `consistent` flag covering the shard's
  internal invariants. The counters live in one `ShardStats` instance entry
  kept up to date by `anchor_batch` and both pruning paths.
- **`multisig-account` (issue #413): daily spending limits for sub-threshold
  signers.** Governance sets a per-token allowance with
  `set_daily_limit(token, limit)` (full threshold). After that, a
  `transfer` of the account's own funds authorized by fewer than `threshold`
  signers is accepted while it fits in each signer's remaining allowance for
  the current 24-hour window (ledger timestamp). Anything else still needs
  the full threshold (`Error::InsufficientSignatures` /
  `Error::DailyLimitExceeded`). Adds `get_daily_limit`, `get_spent_today`
  and `DailyLimitSet`.
- **`state-channel` (issue #412): cooperative mutual close.** The receiver
  registers an Ed25519 key with `register_receiver_key`. `mutual_close(final_state,
  sig_a, sig_b)` then checks both signatures over a domain-separated
  `MutualCloseState` (bound to the contract and channel id), requires the
  split to add up to the escrow, pays both parties at once from `Open`,
  `Closed` or `Disputed`, deletes the channel's storage entries and emits
  `ChannelClosedCooperative`.
- **`refund-policy-time` (issue #426): oracle-assisted dispute resolution.**
  The time policy also accepts `TimeOraclePolicyParams` (`window`,
  `deadline`, `oracle`, `max_report_age`). It asks the delivery oracle for
  the payment's `DeliveryReport`: `Lost` admits the refund even outside the
  window, `Delivered` rejects it with `Error::OraclePolicyDenied`, and
  `Pending` falls back to the window/deadline check. So do stale, future-dated
  or mismatched reports, and oracles that trap or do not exist. Emits
  `OracleResolutionApplied`. Plain `TimePolicyParams` behave as before.
- **`RefundVault` (issue #415): yield-bearing escrow strategy hook.** The
  `YieldStrategy` interface moves to `src/strategy.rs`. Strategies must be
  whitelisted with `approve_yield_strategy` (`revoke_yield_strategy`,
  `is_strategy_approved`) before `set_yield_strategy` / `deploy_to_yield`
  accept them (`Error::StrategyNotApproved`); a strategy still holding
  principal cannot be replaced or revoked (`Error::StrategyHasPrincipal`).
  Deployed principal is now instantly redeemable: `refund`, `claim_batch`,
  `process_batch` and `withdraw` recall any liquidity shortfall from the
  strategy in the same call, checked against the vault's real balance delta.
  `emergency_exit_yield` recalls all principal, even while paused.
  `set_yield_recipient` / `distribute_yield` route harvested yield to the
  protocol treasury or a merchant rebate pool (default: the merchant).
  **Behaviour change:** a refund larger than the liquid float but covered by
  deployed principal now succeeds instead of failing with `InsufficientFloat`.
- **`state-channel` (issue #423): multi-asset collateral pooling.** New
  `open_multi_asset_channel` escrows several tokens in one channel, tracked
  per token as a `BalanceRecord`. Signed `MultiAssetState`s must name exactly
  the channel's asset set (`Error::UnsupportedAsset` otherwise) and keep each
  asset within its own deposit. `settle_multi_asset_channel` pays out every
  asset in one atomic call after the challenge window, and newer states can
  still be submitted during that window. Signatures are bound to the
  contract and channel id.
- **`receipt-anchor` (issue #424): incremental Merkle tree for continuous
  anchoring.** New `insert_receipt_leaf(leaf_hash)` appends one receipt at a
  time to an append-only tree whose frontier (one subtree root per level,
  packed into a single `Bytes` blob) lives in instance storage, so each
  insert costs at most 32 hashes and one storage write. Depth up to 32
  (2^32 leaves). The root is byte-identical to the batch/SDK root of the same
  leaves (checked against `merkle-vectors.json`). Adds
  `get_incremental_root`, `get_incremental_leaf_count` and
  `ReceiptLeafInsertedEvent`.
- **`refund-vault` (issue #427): dust sweep for orphaned escrows.** New
  `sweep_dust(payment_ref)` lets the merchant move a payment's unrefunded
  remainder to a treasury once it is strictly below the dust threshold
  (default 100, configurable with `set_dust_config(threshold, treasury)`)
  and the escrow has been closed (refund window elapsed and no later refund)
  for more than 90 days of ledgers. The swept `RefundV2` record is deleted to
  reclaim storage, and a `DustSweptEvent` is emitted. Treasury falls back to
  the fee recipient when unset.
- **`stream-vault` (issue #410): streaming micro-disbursement schedules.**
  New standalone contract, constructed with `(merchant, token)`.
  `create_stream(buyer, start_ledger, stop_ledger, rate_per_ledger,
  deposit)` escrows a buyer's deposit and streams it linearly to the
  merchant; the claimable balance is `min(deposit, (ledger - start) * rate)`
  less prior claims. `claim_stream` is permissionless and closes the stream
  once the stop ledger is reached. The buyer can `pause_stream` /
  `resume_stream` (resuming shifts the schedule by the paused duration) or
  `cancel_stream`, which pays the merchant what has streamed and returns
  unspent principal. Adds `get_stream` and `get_stream_claimable`. It is a
  separate contract because `RefundVault` has no room left under the
  128 KiB contract size limit, and it keeps buyer escrow apart from the
  refund float.
- **`multisig-account` (issue #425): Ed25519 signature malleability protection.**
  New `crypto` module rejects any signature whose `s` scalar is not strictly
  below the group order `L` (e.g. the malleated twin `(R, s + L)`) with
  `Error::NonCanonicalSignature` *before* host verification; exposed as the
  `verify_ed25519` entrypoint. Also restores the crate's build (misplaced
  module docs, invalid `[u8; 32]` contract types, bad zero-address strkey) and
  makes `rotate_signers_and_threshold` require the account's own auth.
- **Quadratic Voting Module**: Implemented integer square root voting power calculation for the Governance contract to prevent single-whale domination (issue #382).
- **CI WASM Binary Size & Budget Check**: Added automated WASM binary size and CPU/memory budget assertion CI check with `scripts/check_wasm_budget.sh` and GitHub Actions `wasm-budget-inspect` job (issue #381).
- **Timelock Delay Queue**: Added timelock delay queue for sensitive admin actions in multisig-account with `queue_transaction`, `execute_queued_transaction`, `cancel_queued_transaction`, and `approve_queued_transaction` functions (issue #383).
- **Dynamic Threshold Rotation**: Implemented atomic multi-signer threshold reconfiguration in a single call to avoid insecure intermediate states (issue #384).
- **Dual-Asset Support**: Added support for native XLM and SEP-41 tokens in RefundVault.
- **Upto-Authorization Fuzzing**: Added extensive fuzz testing limits.
- **VDF Slashing Penalty**: Accurate assessment of slashing penalty calculations.
- **Time Policy Transitions**: Supported Grace Period and Cooldown transitions.

- **`receipt-anchor` (issue #394): multi-party Ed25519 signature
  aggregation validator in `contracts/receipt-anchor/src/signatures.rs`.**
  A multi-party receipt is authorized by several Ed25519 keys; instead of
  one host `ed25519_verify` per participant it commits every participant to
  one canonical message (contract-domain-separated via the sender-provided
  domain bytes, length-prefixed payload, enumerated keys, and the exact
  participation bitmap) and verifies the single aggregated signature first
  with one host call — `Ok(false)`/`Err` rejects the whole set, and an
  invalid signature traps. `validate_mask` enforces the 32-key cap and that
  no set bit indexes a missing key; `verify_individual_signature` provides
  a per-key audit path. Fully unit-tested in `signatures_test.rs`.
- **`state-channel` (issue #387): dispute-window expiration safeguards.**
  `dispute` now records the exact ledger (`disputed_at`) and transitions the
  channel `Closed -> Disputed` instead of reopening it; `submit_counter_evidence`
  lets anyone holding a newer sender-signed state fight the dispute while the
  window is open (each accepted state re-arms the window); `finalize_dispute`
  is callable by anyone once the window elapses and settles strictly per the
  last verified state — receiver gets `balance`, sender is refunded
  `amount - balance`. Timing helpers live in `contracts/state-channel/src/dispute.rs`.
- **`common` (issue #396): checked financial math helpers in
  `contracts/common/src/math.rs`.** `add_amounts`, `sub_amounts`,
  `mul_amounts`, `div_amounts`, `checked_accumulate`, `mul_ratio`,
  `apply_fee_bps`, checked `u64`<->`i128` conversions and checked
  ledger-sequence arithmetic now return a `MathError` on overflow,
  truncation, or a zero divisor instead of wrapping, saturating, or
  trapping. `Error::MathOverflow` is added and wired through
  `From<MathError>`.
- **`receipt-shard` (issue #395): policy-driven storage eviction for
  expired receipts.** `prune_expired_receipts` deletes batches whose
  anchor is past `RETENTION_LEDGERS`, bounded by `max_count` per call,
  and accrues a per-batch cleanup bounty to the caller, settled via
  `claim_prune_bounty` (zeroed before transfer so a claim cannot pay
  twice) with a `ReceiptsPrunedEvent` published on every call. The scan
  is footprint-safe: it stops at the first gap past the last anchored
  batch instead of iterating the full shard range.
- **Distinct events for every `ReceiptAnchor` state change** (issue #89):
  `prune_batches` now actually emits the long-documented `PruneEvent` — it was
  defined in the code and pinned in `docs/EVENTS.md` but never published —
  bracketing the deleted batch ids as the closed range
  `[start_batch_id, end_batch_id]`, and is suppressed when a call deletes
  nothing so no-op calls do not spam the log. Admin configuration changes emit
  three new events: `InitializedEvent` (from `initialize`; carries the merchant
  and shard wasm hash so a deployment is discoverable from the event log
  alone), `RateLimitUpdatedEvent` (from `set_anchor_rate_limit`; topics carry
  the previous `{burst, refill}` config and the data map the new one, so a
  reader never joins two events) and `AnchorIntervalUpdatedEvent` (from
  `set_min_anchor_interval`; previous interval in the topics, new interval in
  the data map). Both config events also carry the ledger sequence. New events
  are additive — no existing topic tuple or field changed — and each is pinned
  by a test asserting the exact topics and data map the host records
  (`contracts/receipt-anchor/src/test.rs`), with shapes documented in
  `docs/EVENTS.md` and the README event table.
- **`refund-vault-factory` (issue #393): deterministic vault deployment with
  an optional custom salt.** `create_vault` now accepts
  `salt: Option<BytesN<32>>`; passing `Some` derives the deployment address
  via `with_current_contract(salt)` so an identical salt always reproduces an
  identical vault address, and reusing a salt whose derived address already
  holds a deployed vault reverts with `SaltCollision`. The read-only
  `compute_vault_address` entrypoint lets merchants precompute deployment
  addresses off-chain. `deploy_vault` delegates with `None`, leaving the
  existing counter-derived salt family unchanged.
- **`governance` (issue #392): proposal quorum decays toward a safety floor
  over the voting window.** The effective quorum now falls linearly from the
  configured initial threshold to 3 500 bps as a proposal ages across its
  voting window (`contracts/governance/src/quorum.rs`), so inactive proposals
  late in their window need less "yes" weight to pass — but never beneath the
  floor, and "yes" must still outweigh "no".
### Performance

- **`refund-vault`: nonce-key allocation halved in `check_and_bump_user_nonce`
  (issue #295).** `DataKey::UserNonce(caller.clone())` is now constructed once
  and reused for both the storage `get` and `set`, eliminating one
  `Address::clone` per `refund`, `claim_batch`, and `process_batch` call.

- **`refund-vault`: policy-level state reads are now cached once per entry
  point (issue #86).** `claim_single` no longer re-reads the six policy keys
  (`RefundWindow`, `RefundDeadline`, `OraclePolicy`, `VdfDelay`, `Token`,
  `FeeBps`) from instance storage on every claim. A `read_policy_cache` pass
  builds a policy cache up front and `refund`, `claim_batch` and
  `process_batch` share it, removing `6×(N−1)` redundant instance reads for a
  batch of `N` claims (594 fewer reads for `process_batch` at `N=100`).

### Changed

- **`receipt-anchor`: extracted `push_shard_root` and `check_no_duplicate_root`
  helpers from `anchor_batch_internal` (issue #292).** The ring-buffer update
  and per-shard duplicate-root guard are now private methods, shortening the
  main anchoring path and making each responsibility independently readable.

- **`receipt-anchor`: added `build_proof` test helper (issue #291).** The
  inline proof-assembly loop in `test_shared_vectors_match_typescript_sdk` is
  now a reusable `build_proof(env, siblings)` function. The static `vectors.rs`
  data (zero-heap `&'static [[u8; 32]]` slices) is already optimal and required
  no change.

- **`refund-vault`: extracted event-data map helpers in `test.rs` (issue #296).**
  `deposit_event_data`, `refund_event_data`, and `withdraw_event_data` in the
  `event_helpers` module replace inline `Map::<Val, Val>` construction in
  `test_events_emitted`, removing the repeated field-set boilerplate.

### Fixed
- **Build fixes for code merged without compiling.** `governance` declares
  its `voting` and `math` modules and no longer moves `member` before reuse;
  stray `#![no_std]` attributes in submodules (`governance` `ragequit.rs` /
  `voting.rs`, `upto-authorization` `domain.rs`) are removed; unit tests in
  `governance::voting` run inside a contract context, and two `isqrt`
  expectations that were off by 10x are corrected.
- **Known issue, test ignored:** `governance::set_treasury_token` is reachable
  only through `execute` invoking the contract itself, which Soroban rejects
  ("Contract re-entry is not allowed"). Its test is `#[ignore]`d pending a
  design fix.
- **`state-channel`: restore the build.** The merge of #504 dropped the
  `extend_instance_ttl` and `NonceWindow` imports and the `nonce` module
  declaration, and `nonce.rs` used a non-existent `BytesN::zero` and a
  module-level `#![no_std]`.
- **`common`, `refund-vault`: clippy clean again.** Removed a module-level
  `#![no_std]` in `common/src/storage.rs` and a needless borrow in
  `refund-vault`.

- **Repaired source corruption that left `main` unable to compile.** Two bad
  merges (`a6e234b`, then `8eb4fa6` "Resolve conflicts in PR 263") committed
  literal conflict markers into `receipt-anchor/src/lib.rs` and spliced
  function bodies into the wrong signatures across `refund-vault/src/lib.rs`,
  `src/fuzz_test.rs` and `src/test.rs`. Nothing in the workspace built, so
  every check on every branch had been failing. Specifically:
  - `receipt-anchor`: removed the committed `<<<<<<< ours` markers; restored
    `get_shard_capacity`, `get_shard_count`, `get_shard_address` and
    `set_min_anchor_interval`, whose bodies the bad resolution had swallowed
    into `set_anchor_rate_limit`; restored `get_min_anchor_interval` and the
    `MinAnchorInterval` key and `MAX_ANCHOR_INTERVAL` cap they need (the
    governance suite drives this pair end to end).
  - `refund-vault`: rebuilt `__constructor` (it had been left half-merged with
    the removed `initialize` signature), and restored `set_reserve_ratio`,
    `set_max_deploy_ratio`, `deploy_to_yield`, `withdraw_from_yield`,
    `harvest_yield`, `pause`, `set_fee_bps`, `set_fee_recipient`,
    `set_oracle_policy` and `clear_oracle_policy`, each of which had been
    carrying a neighbouring function's body.
  - `fuzz_test.rs`: dropped a dead second op-model (`arb_op`, `execute_op`,
    referencing `Op` variants that no longer exist) that the merge had left
    interleaved with the live one, and restored the `execute` driver and
    `amount_strategy` the live tests call.
- **`Error::InvalidRateLimitConfig` (204)** was referenced by
  `ReceiptAnchor::set_anchor_rate_limit` and its tests but never existed on the
  shared `Error` enum. Added.
- **`test_extend_refund_ttl_fails_if_missing`** called `get_refund` (which
  returns `Option` and cannot yield `RefundNotFound`) instead of
  `extend_refund_ttl`, so it never tested what it was named for.
- **`test_nonce_does_not_increment_on_failed_operation`** called the removed
  `set_refund_window`, and with a window that contradicted its own
  `WindowExpired` assertion. Removed the stale call.

### Changed

- **`receipt_anchor` WASM budget raised 48000 -> 59000 bytes.** The 48000 figure
  was set before sharding, the token-bucket rate limiter and the zk verifier
  landed, and was never re-validated because the contract had not compiled
  since. 59000 reflects the contract as actually built (58847 bytes).

### Removed

- **`RefundVault::test_uninitialized_calls_fail`** and
  **`test_set_yield_strategy_uninitialized_fails`** asserted `NotInitialized`
  on a vault registered without arguments. Issue #129 moved initialization into
  `__constructor`, so that state is now unreachable — registration itself
  fails. Replaced by `test_vault_cannot_be_deployed_without_config`, which
  asserts the stronger constructor-level property; the auth path stays covered
  by `test_set_yield_strategy_requires_auth`.

- **CI and Toolchain Configuration**: updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use stable `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` action references and synchronized `Cargo.lock` with dependency changes.

### Added

- **`RefundVaultFactory` with constructor-wired vaults** (issue #129): vaults
  are now created by a singleton factory via `deploy_vault(vault_init)` and are
  fully initialized in their constructor — there is no `initialize` window to
  front-run. The factory owns the deployment inputs a merchant must not be able
  to pick (`vault_wasm_hash`, and the stateless time/VDF policy contract
  addresses), derives a deterministic salt per merchant, and authorizes the
  merchant so griefing on someone else's salt family is impossible. Policy
  resolution: a policy set on the merchant's `VaultInit` wins; `None` falls
  back to the factory's global policy addresses. A vault deployed with a `None`
  policy on an active gate is still deployable but refuses the gate at claim
  time with `PolicyContractsNotConfigured` (317). The time and VDF gates are
  delegated to new stateless `TimePolicy` and `VdfPolicy` contracts
  (`contracts/refund-policy-time`, `contracts/refund-policy-vdf`) that
  evaluate a claim's window/deadline and Wesolowski proof respectively, keeping
  per-vault storage and upgrade surface small. Direct (non-factory)
  deployments of `RefundVault` remain supported.

- **Never persist `Option::None` (a `Void` value) in contract storage**: the
  vault and factory formerly stored their `Option<Address>` policy fields
  verbatim, so a cleared policy left a `Void` in the ledger, which the host
  rejects/breaks on in several read paths (observed as `Error(Context,
  InvalidAction)` and abort traps in the wasm constructor path). Policy fields
  are now written only when `Some`, and setters `remove()` the key on `None`.
  Absent key ⇔ unconfigured, which is the correct on-chain semantic anyway
  (`Void` is not a legal contract-data value).

- **Per-user nonce replay protection** (issue #122): `refund`, `claim_batch`,
  and `process_batch` now each take a required `nonce` argument equal to the
  caller's (merchant's) current per-user counter, stored in persistent storage
  under `DataKey::UserNonce(Address)`. The counter starts at `0`, increments
  once per **successful** claim call, and a mismatch — replaying a consumed
  nonce or skipping ahead — reverts the call with `Error::StaleState`
  (mirroring the state channel's nonce semantics). Failed claims revert
  atomically and do not consume a nonce; an empty `process_batch` returns
  early without consuming one. New `get_user_nonce(caller)` getter, and new
  tests covering sequential advance, replay rejection, per-caller
  independence, and batched entry points. This is a **breaking interface
  change** to the three claim entry points.

### Changed

- **`Governance` contract**: a proposal-based, weighted-vote governance wrapper
  that closes the single-admin-key SPOF on `ReceiptAnchor`'s merchant role. A
  fixed set of members (each with a weight, set at construction) can `propose`
  a call to any target contract, `vote` on it over a bounded voting window,
  and once "yes" weight clears a configured quorum (in basis points) and
  strictly exceeds "no" weight, anyone can `execute` it. No change to the
  governed contract is required: `initialize` `ReceiptAnchor` with a
  `Governance` instance's address as `merchant`, and its existing
  merchant-gated calls (`set_min_anchor_interval`, `anchor_batch`,
  `prune_batches`) become reachable only through a passed proposal — the
  host's own self-authorization rule (a contract's `require_auth()` on its
  own address auto-succeeds when it is the direct caller) is what carries the
  authority through, the same mechanism already used for a `MultisigAccount`
  admin. Storage is kept intentionally small: each member's weight is its own
  persistent entry, per-voter "already voted" markers live in **temporary**
  storage so they expire on their own with the voting window, and a resolved
  proposal's calldata can be reclaimed immediately via `prune_proposal`
  rather than waiting on archival. `ReceiptAnchor` has no upgrade entry point
  (see `docs/ADR-003-upgradeability.md`, which forbids adding one without
  reopening that ADR), so this wrapper does not gate or introduce one — it
  covers the admin surface that actually exists today. See
  `contracts/governance/src/lib.rs` and
  `contracts/governance/tests/receipt_anchor_admin.rs`.

- **Commit-reveal front-running protection for `RefundVault`** (issue #128):
  sensitive vault operations (`refund`, `claim_batch`, `propose_policy`) are
  visible in the mempool, so a validator or bot could observe a merchant's
  transaction and submit a competing one with a higher fee, reordering the
  pool. To close that window, `RefundVault` now implements a commit-reveal
  scheme: the merchant first calls `commit(operation, commitment_hash)` to
  bind a SHA-256 hash of the intended action (with no plaintext visible), then
  calls `reveal(operation, commitment_hash, plaintext)` no earlier than
  `COMMIT_MIN_DELAY_LEDGERS` (7) ledgers later to surface and consume the
  action. `reveal` re-derives the hash from the plaintext and rejects a
  mismatch (`CommitMismatch`), a reveal before the delay (`CommitDelayNot
  Elapsed`), a reveal with no pending commit (`NoCommit`), a reveal under a
  different operation than the one committed (`CommitOperationMismatch`), and
  a duplicate pending commit (`CommitAlreadyExists`). Commitments are
  merchant-only and single-use. New error codes 305–309 are appended without
  renumbering. `get_commit_min_delay()` and `get_commit(hash)` are added as
  read-only getters.

- **VDF-gated refunds for `RefundVault`** (issue #138): the refund policy now
  carries a Verifiable Delay Function requirement — `propose_policy(ledgers,
  deadline, vdf_delay)` configures a delay in squarings (subject to the same
  timelock) and `execute_policy` applies it. When the policy has a delay
  configured, `refund`, every claim in `claim_batch`, and every item in
  `process_batch` must supply a valid **Wesolowski VDF proof** that the delay
  has genuinely elapsed; claims without one fail with `VdfProofRequired`
  (302), with an invalid or premature one with `InvalidVdfProof` (303), and a
  proof supplied against a policy with no delay with `VdfNotConfigured` (304).
  The proof is bound to the payment (challenge = `sha256(payment_ref)`), so it
  cannot be replayed across payments, and the delay is *computational* — a
  validator that controls block timestamps or transaction ordering cannot
  shorten it without factoring the contract's fixed 1024-bit modulus. The
  verifier (`contracts/refund-vault/src/vdf.rs`) runs in pure WASM via
  `crypto-bigint` (already in the dependency tree, so no new transitive
  crates), is exposed publicly as read-only `verify_vdf(challenge, delay,
  proof)` for randomness-verification flows, and its cost is pinned by a
  budget test (a verification measures ≈51k CPU units — about a tenth of a
  refund call). The new `get_vdf_delay()` getter exposes the configured delay.
  This is a **breaking change** for clients: the `propose_policy` signature is
  extended and `refund`/`RefundClaim`/`RefundParam` gain a `vdf_proof`
  argument/field. `initialize` is unchanged and existing deployments default
  to no delay (`0`), keeping them behaviour- and storage-compatible. The
  contract's modulus is a fixed constant with its factors discarded after
  generation; a production deployment should replace it with a
  ceremony-chosen modulus (see `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` § "VDF Fairness").

- **ZK validity proof batch anchoring for `ReceiptAnchor`**: `anchor_batch_zk`
  allows merchants to anchor batch state roots on-chain by providing a Groth16
  zero-knowledge validity proof (`ZkProof`), verifying validity in $O(1)$ time
  and saving computational overhead on-chain. Added `verify_zk_proof` to verify
  Groth16 proofs against verifying keys and public inputs, and introduced
  `Error::InvalidProof` (code 203).


- **Best-effort batch refunds for `RefundVault`**: `process_batch(refunds)`
  processes up to 100 claims in one transaction (`Vec<RefundParam>`, same shape
  as `RefundClaim`) under a single merchant authorization, returning
  `Vec<bool>` with one entry per claim. A failing claim is recorded as `false`
  and processing continues, so valid claims in a mixed batch complete rather
  than the whole call aborting; a batch larger than 100 claims fails with
  `BatchTooLarge`. Every claim runs the identical per-claim logic as `refund`
  (deadline, ceiling, float, and the configured fee), publishing a
  `RefundEvent` per applied claim. Non-atomic by design — callers that require
  all-or-nothing semantics should use `claim_batch` instead.
- **Batch refunds for `RefundVault`**: `claim_batch(claims)` refunds multiple
  claims in a single transaction, each processed with exactly the same logic,
  checks, fees and events as `refund`, sharing one merchant authorization and
  one reentrancy-lock acquisition. The batch is **atomic** — the first failing
  claim returns its error and the Soroban transaction revert discards every
  transfer, storage write and event of the batch, so either all claims persist
  or none do. The float is read fresh from the token contract before every
  element (so a batch cannot overdraw the vault), and repeated `payment_ref`s
  accumulate against the same ceiling across elements. Each claim publishes its
  own `RefundEvent` in claim order; an empty batch succeeds as a no-op. Callers
  pass a `Vec<RefundClaim>`, a `#[contracttype]` struct mirroring the `refund`
  arguments (`payment_ref`, `recipient`, `amount`, `paid_at_ledger`,
  `payment_amount`). This is an **additive** change: `refund` and every existing
  endpoint are unchanged (the shared claim path is extracted verbatim), and gas
  is pinned by a budget test asserting a ten-claim batch stays well under the
  default CPU and memory limits and scales near-linearly with a single claim.
- **Refund fees for `RefundVault`**: the merchant can configure a fee deducted
  from every successful refund — `set_fee_bps(bps)` fixes the rate (basis
  points, up to 10_000) and `set_fee_recipient(recipient)` the collector
  address; both are admin-only and setting the recipient to the vault's own
  address is rejected (`SelfTransfer`). `refund` splits each claim into the
  buyer's payout and the fee, which always rounds **up** so the sub-unit
  remainder accrues to the protocol. If no recipient is configured the fee
  defaults to the merchant. The total outflow per claim is unchanged
  (`payout + fee == amount`), the `payment_amount` ceiling and the float check
  are untouched, and the fee is `0` unless configured, so `initialize` and
  existing deployments are unaffected. New `get_fee_bps()` /
  `get_fee_recipient()` getters expose the configuration, and the
  `RefundEvent` data map gains a `fee` field (append-only, see
  `docs/EVENTS.md`).
- **Refund expiration deadline for `RefundVault`**: the refund policy now
  carries a wall-clock deadline (Unix timestamp) alongside the ledger-based
  window — `propose_policy(ledgers, deadline)` configures it (subject to the
  same timelock) and `execute_policy` applies it. `refund` rejects claims whose
  current ledger timestamp is strictly past the deadline with a new
  `RefundExpired` error (code 23); a deadline of `0` disables expiry. The new
  `get_refund_deadline()` getter exposes the configured deadline. This is a
  contract-source change: the `propose_policy` signature is extended, so it is
  a **breaking change** for clients; `initialize` is unchanged and existing
  deployments default to no expiration (deadline `0`), keeping them behaviour-
  and storage-compatible. Deadline boundary semantics are pinned by unit tests
  that manipulate the mock ledger timestamp.

- **Admin events for `RefundVault`** (issue #114): `PauseEvent` and
  `UnpauseEvent` carry the ledger sequence so a pause window is reconstructible
  from the event log alone, and `RefundWindowUpdatedEvent` carries both the
  previous and the new window (old value captured before overwrite). All three
  follow the existing `#[contractevent]` convention and are documented in
  `docs/EVENTS.md` and the README event table.
- **Trustworthy build provenance in `contractmeta`** (issue #164): both
  `build.rs` files now fail loudly (a `cargo:warning`) when the git commit hash
  cannot be resolved instead of silently embedding `"unknown"`, embed a new
  `commit_dirty` key computed from `git status --porcelain`, and re-run on
  `.git/HEAD`, the resolved branch ref, the index and `src/` so a cached build
  cannot report a stale hash. A `test_commit_meta_is_well_formed` test in both
  crates pins the embedded commit to 40 hex characters.
- **Oracle aggregator for dynamic refund policies** (`RefundVault`): a
  standard `Oracle` interface (`get_price` + `get_last_update_ledger`) that
  any price/data feed contract can implement, merchant-whitelisted via
  `add_oracle`/`remove_oracle`/`get_oracles`; a median aggregator
  (`get_median_price`) that queries every whitelisted oracle for a feed and
  returns the median of the fresh (non-stale) values, so no single provider
  is trusted; and an `OraclePolicy` (feed, threshold, staleness bound,
  `refund_when_below`) installed via `set_oracle_policy`/`clear_oracle_policy`
  that gates `refund` and `process_batch` — a refund is only paid out while
  the aggregated feed satisfies the condition, failing closed on a missing
  whitelist or all-stale data. New events `oracle_policy_set_event` /
  `oracle_policy_cleared_event` and error codes 302–307
  (`NoOraclesConfigured`, `OracleAlreadyAdded`, `OracleNotFound`,
  `StaleOracleData`, `NoOraclePolicy`, `OraclePolicyDenied`).

### Changed

- **CI fixes**: the `build-wasm` job now builds the deployable contract crates
  with `--workspace --exclude testutils` — the `testutils` workspace member
  activates `soroban-sdk`'s `testutils` feature, which is not supported on the
  `wasm32v1-none` target and made every wasm build fail at the SDK boundary.


  The `.wasm-budget.json` size budgets are updated to the current deterministic
  release builds (receipt-anchor 33,067 B, refund-vault 85,453 B) with ~5%
  headroom — the exact-pin approach kept breaking on toolchain drift, and the
  refund-vault budget had not caught up with the VDF crypto code.

  The `ReceiptAnchor` budget gate in `fuzz_test.rs` is re-baselined for
  `verify_receipt`: the pure-WASM SHA-256 folding merged in #250 moved hashing
  out of the host into WASM, raising the host CPU instruction count for that
  path (~569.9k → ~780.8k) while cutting WASM instructions; the gate's limits
  now reflect the current implementation (measured 2026-08-29) and still allow
  15% headroom for toolchain drift.

- **Lower-cost Merkle proof verification** (issue #125): `ReceiptShard` and
  `ReceiptAnchor` now fold sorted-pair proofs in a single iterative pure-WASM
  SHA-256 loop, avoiding redundant proof buffering and host crypto roundtrips.
  Batch-size instruction measurements were added to the ReceiptAnchor test suite
  and documented in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.


- **Advanced WASM Memory Management for Merkle Proofs** (issue #139):
  Refactored `ReceiptShard::verify_receipt` to copy host vector inputs into a stack-allocated
  static buffer (`proof_buffer: [[u8; 32]; 128]`) and perform intermediate hashing using the pure Wasm
  `sha2` crate. This eliminates all guest heap allocations and host roundtrips for intermediate hashes,
  ensuring a flat guest memory footprint across all Merkle tree depths.
- **`RefundVault` token generality is documented and pinned** (issue #166): the
  vault treats all amounts as raw integer units in the token's smallest unit and
  performs no decimal arithmetic, so any SEP-41 precision behaves identically.
  New `token_agnostic_tests.rs` proves the full lifecycle (deposit, refund,
  withdraw, float-bound check) against 0- and 2-decimal tokens, including the
  smallest unit, i128 extremes, and a refund exactly equal to the float.
  Documented in `docs/storage-audit.md` (Token Generality) and
  `docs/contracts.mdx`.

### Security

- **Merchant-only float funding is a documented guarantee** (issue #157):
  `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` now states it explicitly — only the merchant's own
  funds are ever at stake, a third party cannot contribute float the merchant
  has not authorised, and `withdraw` stays merchant-only. The existing
  `test_deposit_from_non_merchant_fails` pins the behaviour and is annotated as
  deliberate.

### Fixed

- **`main` was failing CI** (left red by the advanced-wasm-memory merge):
  restored the truncated `assert_eq!` in
  `test_process_batch_exceeds_max_size_fails` (the file would not parse),
  fixed the clippy 1.98 `needless_borrow` / `unnecessary_cast` violations,
  excluded the host-only `testutils` crate from the wasm artifact build (it
  enables soroban-sdk's `testutils` feature, which the SDK rejects on wasm),
  and re-baselined the cost-regression constants and wasm size budgets to the
  freshly measured values (`verify_receipt` CPU 569,906 → 780,985 after the
  pure-Wasm sha2 rewrite; `refund` CPU 397,721 → 477,714; `refund_vault.wasm`
  37,376 → 56,320 bytes; `receipt_anchor.wasm` 24,576 → 33,792 bytes on the
  current toolchain).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-26

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **`refund` gained a required `payment_amount` argument** (issue #99). Refunds
  are now cumulative: each call adds `amount` to a running total for the
  `payment_ref`, and the total can never exceed the `payment_amount` ceiling.
  The refund window is still measured from `paid_at_ledger`, never from a
  partial.
- **`RefundRecord` layout changed and is stored under a new key.** The single
  `amount` field is replaced by `amount_refunded` + `payment_amount`, and
  records are stored under a new `RefundV2` storage key. A `Refund` key written
  by the 0.2.0 single-refund rule is still recognised and treated as a
  fully-refunded payment (rejected with `ExceedsPayment`), never mis-decoded.
- **Error codes are unified across both contracts** (issue #98). Both contracts
  now return the single `accensa-common` `Error` enum; the two codes that used
  to collide (`AlreadyInitialized`, `NotInitialized`) keep their original
  values, and the anchor-only codes moved to a dedicated block (100+) so no two
  variants overlap. See the error table in the README.

### Added

`RefundVault`:

- **Partial refunds** — a payment may be refunded across multiple calls, each
  emitting a `RefundEvent` carrying both the per-call amount and the cumulative
  total, so an indexer never has to sum history.
- **Multisig contract-account admin support is verified and documented** (issue
  #97). Tests prove both contracts work with a `__check_auth` contract account
  as merchant — see `contracts/multisig-account`,
  `contracts/refund-vault/tests/multisig_admin_vault.rs` and
  `contracts/receipt-anchor/tests/multisig_admin_anchor.rs`.
- **Tests for the two README cross-contract claims** (issue #163):
  `readme_claim_payment_ref_is_receipt_leaf` and
  `readme_claim_refunds_outlive_pruned_batches` in
  `contracts/refund-vault/tests/integration_test.rs`.

### Added

- CI job enforcing `CHANGELOG.md` updates on contract changes and checking version alignment (#192).
- Shared cross-implementation test vectors and conformance suite for `RefundVault` (#184).
- Dependabot configuration for `cargo` and `github-actions` (#185).
- CI WASM artifact uploading and size budget enforcement gate (#186).

### Fixed

- **Build was broken on `main` after the yield-strategy merge (#200).** The
  `YieldStrategy` trait used `#[contractimpl]`, which cannot generate a client on
  a bare trait; it is now `#[contractclient(name = "YieldStrategyClient")]`.
  `deploy_to_yield` also transferred tokens to the strategy without notifying it
  (`strategy_client.deposit`), so the strategy never recorded the principal and
  later withdrawals failed. `yield_tests.rs` additionally used event APIs that
  do not exist in this SDK. No deployed contract is affected — this restores a
  compiling, green test suite.

### Tested

- Property-based fuzz suites in `contracts/*/src/fuzz_test.rs` now generate
  random operation sequences and assert invariants after every step: pruning
  stays a contiguous prefix with a monotonic `PrunedUpTo` cursor, Merkle
  verification rejects every wrong proof shape (wrong leaf/sibling/length/batch
  and reversed level order), vault float always equals
  `deposits - refunds - withdrawals` and never goes negative, cumulative
  refunds per `payment_ref` never exceed the supplied ceiling, paused
  operations never mutate state, and TTL extension never shortens a TTL while
  missing records always error. Budgets
  are tunable via `FUZZ_CASES`/`FUZZ_SEQ_LEN` with longer `#[ignore]`d local
  profiles.

### Deployment status

Like `0.2.0`, this is a source release: the live testnet addresses in
[`DEPLOYMENTS.md`](DEPLOYMENTS.md) still run `0.1.0`, and the new `refund`
signature, event shapes and error codes **do not exist at those addresses**.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-14

Everything below has been merged and tested on `main`. **It is not what is deployed
on testnet** — see [Deployment status](#deployment-status).

### ⚠️ Breaking

- **Event topics changed and any indexer written against `0.1.0` matches nothing.**
  `0.1.0` published events by hand as `("anchored", batch_id)` and
  `("refunded", payment_ref)`. Both contracts now derive their events with
  `#[contractevent]`, which emits the topics `anchor_event`, `prune_event`,
  `deposit_event`, `refund_event`, and `withdraw_event`. The README advertised the
  old topics for three weeks after the code had changed; that is fixed, and the
  shapes are now pinned as a contract in [`docs/EVENTS.md`](docs/EVENTS.md) with an
  Event Stability Policy in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) so it cannot drift
  again silently.

### Added

`ReceiptAnchor`:

- `extend_batch_ttl(batch_id)` — public and unauthenticated, so anyone can stop an
  anchored batch being archived.
- `prune_batches(before_ledger)` — merchant-authorised, walking forward from a
  persisted `PrunedUpTo` cursor and stopping at the first batch not old enough, so
  the pruned range stays a contiguous prefix and no batch is ever removed from the
  middle.
- `get_batch_count()` — exposes the batch count; a maximum batch size is now
  enforced on `anchor_batch`.
- `AnchorEvent` and `PruneEvent`.

`RefundVault`:

- `pause()` / `unpause()` under merchant auth. Deposit, refund and withdraw all
  reject while paused.
- `extend_refund_ttl(payment_ref)` — public and unauthenticated, same rationale as
  above.
- `DepositEvent`, `RefundEvent` and `WithdrawEvent`, so the vault is indexable
  rather than poll-only.

Both:

- `contractmeta!` embedding `name`, `version`, `repo` and the build's `GIT_SHA`
  via a `build.rs`, so a deployed contract can be traced to its exact source
  commit. `deploy.sh` now records wasm `sha256sum` alongside the contract IDs.

### Changed

- `soroban-sdk` 27.0.0 → 27.0.4.
- TTL constants set to roughly 30 days of ledgers, with a threshold so a bump is
  not written on every call. Archival and restore implications are documented.
- `refund` now validates `amount > 0`.

### Fixed

- `RefundVault` storage `.set()` calls corrected.
- README test counts and event-topic names no longer contradict the code.

### Documentation

- [`docs/EVENTS.md`](docs/EVENTS.md) — the indexer-facing event contract.
- [`docs/storage-audit.md`](docs/storage-audit.md) — rewritten from a single line
  of escaped text into an audit of all 13 `DataKey` variants, with storage class,
  justification, TTL strategy and projected rent.
- [`docs/ADR-002`](docs/ADR-002-upto-scheme.md) — design notes on the x402 `upto`
  scheme for Stellar. Status **DRAFT**: the construction has not been validated
  against the upstream spec, a running contract, or Soroban's authorization
  semantics, and §6 lists what must be confirmed first.
- [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md), [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md),
  and a SEP-41 section in [`docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md)
  recording why `RefundVault` lets a missing-trustline transfer panic at the token
  rather than paying the budget cost of a pre-check.

### Testing

- 25 → **58 tests**: `receipt-anchor` 24, `refund-vault` 29, and 5 cross-contract
  integration tests that replaced a placeholder asserting nothing. The integration
  tests cover receipt correspondence, double-refund against a valid proof, refund
  of a payment inside a pruned batch, TTL archival across both contracts, and the
  pause interaction.
- `verify_receipt` remains pinned to conformance vectors shared with the
  TypeScript SDK, so off-chain and on-chain verification are proven to agree.

### Deployment status

**The testnet deployment has deliberately not been updated to `0.2.0`.** The
contracts live at:

| Contract | Contract ID | Version deployed |
|---|---|---|
| `ReceiptAnchor` | `CBHRJU7CF4XIFRNDITFHNQHABKBMFM2FYFHLGWN3JGSFYYCDSMDAWPRV` | `0.1.0` |
| `RefundVault` | `CCMBM44EJUGD52G4LSMGHSXMAH2KSAQZX7VOYY4TTBF5BK4D7M4IHRQA` | `0.1.0` |

Soroban deployment mints a new contract ID. Redeploying would invalidate every
published address — including the ones the public receipt verifier at
<https://accensa-dashboard.vercel.app/verify> reads live, and every contract link
in this repository and in `accensa-app`. So `0.2.0` is a **source release**: the
tag, the notes and the reproducible build are the artifact. A redeployment is a
coordinated change across both repositories and is tracked separately in
[#59](https://github.com/accensa/accensa-contracts/issues/59), which also covers
pubnet.

Practical consequence: the new functions above and the new event topics exist in
the source and in the tagged build, **not at those two addresses**. Anything
reading the live contracts should keep treating them as `0.1.0`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-14

First testnet deployment. `ReceiptAnchor` with `anchor_batch`, `get_batch`,
`verify_receipt` and `initialize`; `RefundVault` with `deposit`, `refund`,
`withdraw`, `get_refund`, `set_refund_window` and `initialize`. Contract IDs and
the transactions that created them are recorded in
[`DEPLOYMENTS.md`](DEPLOYMENTS.md).
